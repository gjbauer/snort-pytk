# What is [Intrusion detection system overview report.pdf](https://github.com/WhiteHatCyberus/Deep-Model-Evaluation-Intrusion-Detection-System-using-NSL-KDD-CIC-IDS-2018/blob/main/intrusion%20detection%20system%20overview%20report.pdf) ??
This is primarily for the beginners to understand what an IDS is and how it works, Ive added powerpoint slides of references at the end of the report.
* I discussed what an IDS is, types of IDS, detection methods
* Talked about Firewalls, and compared an IDS versus an Enterprise Firewall
* Furthermore, I talked about the Open Source IDS, SNORT and its 3 operational modes and compared it with other counterparts like Suricata and Bro.
* Finally I did add the literature Survey where I compiled all the papers that helped me take an indepth seminar of the IDS and also gave me an insight to simulate real time attacks on the system.
* Ive added the whole architecture of the working of an IDS and its deep model architecture.
Hope this helps ;)
